# informatin
 online learning platform for assistance in lectures

 > Informatin is now moved to mercurial and will be developed in its repository. This repository will not be updated anymore.

## The goal
 Lecutrers have recently started to use online services as assistance to their lecture. That could be quiz, video, search engines, slides or data sharing services.
 
 But this is not structurized!

 There should be one generalized tool or a "lecture assistant"-site for every lecture, where the material is placed and can be accessed easily.

 This is an attempt to solve the issue.

## Usage
 - The `index.php` file should be placed on some webserver.
 - The `*.txt` files should be in the same directory. The URLs in them will be displayed on different parts of the webpage.

## Future: Functions to be added
 - [ ] Dynamical webpage-generator
 - [ ] Manage multiple webpages
   - [ ] Add and remove, lock and unlock pages
   - [ ] Sharing links
 - [x] Inclusion in `mercurial.`
   - [ ] Using fork from this repository or so.
